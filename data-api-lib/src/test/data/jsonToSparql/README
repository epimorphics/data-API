README for data-api-lib/src/test/data/jsonToSparql

This directory contains files used by TestJSONtoSPARQL,
which names specific clusters of files and uses them as
gold tests.

A file SPOO.ttl is a API_Dataset configuration file
used by tests constructed from SPOO-name.json and
SPOO-name.rq. The test constructs a DataQuery from
SPOO-name.json using the aspects defined in SPOO.ttl,
and then compares it with SPOO-name.rq. If they are
not equal the test fails.
